I (27F) have a very high sex drive and I get a shit ton of mental stimulation/reward or whatever for doing sexual things. From 5 AM blowjobs to dirty photos to blindfolds and cuffs. I am pretty sure I am bisexual although I am about to be 27 and I’ve only had experiences with females like 11+ years ago and most of them were only making out with me because the guys thought it was hot. I had ONE girl come over for sex once and I rather enjoyed it but it was my first time and I didn’t perform well, especially since the girl didn’t know me well and my overly sensitive gag reflex was triggered once or twice while giving oral (fml) and that probably made her feel bad and she never talked to me ever again despite going to the same high school. And then I was in abusive relationship after abusive relationship. Now I am married to a guy and we have a kid. My husband likes regular sex. I’ve bought toys and blindfolds and stuff before but he has never used them with me. He is embarrassed about sexting. I never get even a shirtless photo of him even though he has thousands of my nudes. It’s been almost 8 years. I have begged for years now to have sex at least twice a week. This past month it has been more frequent but typically we are only having sex maybe once a month, twice if I’m lucky. And it’s nothing super kinky. Just typical blowjobs and usually missionary sex. I have a tilted uterus and his dick curves to the left and it hurts a lot to do like “doggy style” (god I really fucking hate that term) with him. I like to be on top sometimes but I don’t do it often because I don’t orgasm that way and he’s done after orgasming once usually. So if I’m on top then I get nothing basically and it was all for him. I’m fighting for enough as it is. This is where my high sex drive becomes an issue. I don’t know how to change it and how to be less sex-driven. I always want to post my nudes online to get attention from people and to see where I lay on the “attractive scale”. But I am married and I would feel so bad to hurt my husband so I just don’t. I have a hard time keeping female friends because I’ve repressed my bisexuality for so long that I’m like a starving wolf locked in a cage, drooling at a steak. I can’t see bra ads or anything without really fantasizing about the model. And oh god if a girl changes in front of me AHHH. I feel so ashamed of myself. I am married and a mother. Why can’t I be like all the girls I read about who hate sex? That way I would be happy. Sorry for this long, horribly written, desperate, stupid post. I am desperate and stupid so try not to expect too much from me. nnOh and just to avoid any “maybe you’re ugly” kind of thoughts, I am 5’4, 123 lbs, wear size 4 jeans, and a 34D bra. My nose is kinda big but I think I’m pretty, especially when I do my makeup, although I really don’t need the makeup.

I (27F) have a very high sex drive and I get a shit ton of mental stimulation/reward or whatever for doing sexual things. From 5 AM blowjobs to dirty photos to blindfolds and cuffs. I am pretty sure I am bisexual although I am about to be 27 and I’ve only had experiences with females like 11+ years ago and most of them were only making out with me because the guys thought it was hot. I had ONE girl come over for sex once and I rather enjoyed it but it was my first time and I didn’t perform well, especially since the girl didn’t know me well and my overly sensitive gag reflex was triggered once or twice while giving oral (fml) and that probably made her feel bad and she never talked to me ever again despite going to the same high school. And then I was in abusive relationship after abusive relationship. Now I am married to a guy and we have a kid. My husband likes regular sex. I’ve bought toys and blindfolds and stuff before but he has never used them with me. He is embarrassed about sexting. I never get even a shirtless photo of him even though he has thousands of my nudes. It’s been almost 8 years. I have begged for years now to have sex at least twice a week. This past month it has been more frequent but typically we are only having sex maybe once a month, twice if I’m lucky. And it’s nothing super kinky. Just typical blowjobs and usually missionary sex. I have a tilted uterus and his dick curves to the left and it hurts a lot to do like “doggy style” (god I really fucking hate that term) with him. I like to be on top sometimes but I don’t do it often because I don’t orgasm that way and he’s done after orgasming once usually. So if I’m on top then I get nothing basically and it was all for him. I’m fighting for enough as it is. This is where my high sex drive becomes an issue. I don’t know how to change it and how to be less sex-driven. I always want to post my nudes online to get attention from people and to see where I lay on the “attractive scale”. But I am married and I would feel so bad to hurt my husband so I just don’t. I have a hard time keeping female friends because I’ve repressed my bisexuality for so long that I’m like a starving wolf locked in a cage, drooling at a steak. I can’t see bra ads or anything without really fantasizing about the model. And oh god if a girl changes in front of me AHHH. I feel so ashamed of myself. I am married and a mother. Why can’t I be like all the girls I read about who hate sex? That way I would be happy. Sorry for this long, horribly written, desperate, stupid post. I am desperate and stupid so try not to expect too much from me. &lt;/p&gt;nn&lt;p&gt;Oh and just to avoid any “maybe you’re ugly” kind of thoughts, I am 5’4, 123 lbs, wear size 4 jeans, and a 34D bra.

Why should I stick to the law when the people who tell me to are hypocrites? Why should I stick to my job when I'm being underpaid and taken advantage of? Why should I have faith in my friends when their ignorance is the reason I struggle? nnI turned 18 last month, I'm an adult now, but I feel like I've lived a hundred years already. I'm tired, I'm cold, I'm lonely, I'm sick of dealing with all the struggle of life. I don't know how adults do it, spend years and years yearning for one thing to bless them, money. The only time anyone seems happy is at the end of the month when the money goes in their pockets. No matter the struggle, they're crawl their way into the pit and grab it. nnNot much I can really do about it though,  I can complain and complain but I'm apart of the problem in the end. I always try to be optimistic but when I'm alone all I can think about it negativity. nnSometimes I just want to go out and do something nuts, DO SOMETHING that will impact people's lives, whether it be positive or negative.
